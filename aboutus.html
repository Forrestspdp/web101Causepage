			<h1>OUR STORY</h1>
		<div> We are a non-profit organization with a mission to connect people through lending to alleviate poverty. Leveraging the internet and a worldwide network of microfinance institutions, our foundation lets individuals lend as little as $25 to help create opportunity around the world. 
		</div>
		<div> Why we do what we do? We envision a world where all people - even in the most remote areas of the globe - hold the power to create opportunity for themselves and others.
		</div>

		<div>We believe providing safe, affordable access to capital to those in need helps people create better lives for themselves and their families.
		</div>
